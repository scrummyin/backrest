                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed an issue where specifying <setting>--no-archive-check</setting> would throw a configuration error.  <i>Reported by Jason O'Donnell</i>.</text>
                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed an issue where a temp WAL file left over after a well-timed system crash could cause the next <cmd>archive-push</cmd> to fail.</text>
                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed an issue where document generation failed because some OSs are not tolerant of having multiple installed versions of <postgres/>.  A separate VM is now created for each version.  Also added a sleep after database starts during document generation to ensure the database is running before the next command runs. <i>Reported by John Harvey</i>.</text>
                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>The <setting>retention-archive</setting> option can now be be safely set to less than backup retention (<setting>retention-full</setting> or <setting>retention-diff</setting>) without also specifying <setting>archive-copy=n</setting>.  The WAL required to make the backups that fall outside of archive retention consistent will be preserved in the archive.  However, in this case PITR will not be possible for the backups that fall outside of archive retention.</text>
                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>When backing up and restoring tablespaces <backrest/> only operates on the subdirectory created for the version of <postgres/> being run against.  Since multiple versions can live in a tablespace (especially during a binary upgrade) this prevents too many files from being copied during a backup and other versions possibly being wiped out during a restore.  This only applies to <postgres/> >= 9.0 -- prior versions of <postgres/> could not share a tablespace directory.</text>
                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>Generate an error when <setting>archive-check=y</setting> but <setting>archive_command</setting> does not execute <file>pg_backrest</file>. <i>Contributed by Jason O'Donnell</i>.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Improved error message when <setting>repo-path</setting> or <setting>repo-remote-path</setting> does not exist.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added checks for <setting>--delta</setting> and <setting>--force</setting> restore options to ensure that the destination is a valid $PGDATA directory.  <backrest/> will check for the presence of <file>PG_VERSION</file> or <file>backup.manifest</file> (left over from an aborted restore).  If neither file is found then <setting>--delta</setting> and <setting>--force</setting> will be disabled but the restore will proceed unless there are files in the $PGDATA directory (or any tablespace directories) in which case the operation will be aborted.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>When restore <setting>--set=latest</setting> (the default) the actual backup restored will be output to the log.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Support for <postgres/> 9.5 partial WAL segments and <setting>recovery_target_action</setting> setting. The <setting>archive_mode = 'always'</setting> setting is not yet supported.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Support for <setting>recovery_target = 'immediate'</setting> recovery setting introduced in <postgres/> 9.4.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>The following tablespace checks have been added: paths or files in pg_tblspc, relative links in pg_tblspc, tablespaces in $PGDATA. All three will generate errors.</text>

            <release-feature-bullet-list>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed an issue where longer-running backups/restores would timeout when remote and threaded.  Keepalives are now used to make sure the remote for the main process does not timeout while the thread remotes do all the work.  The error message for timeouts was also improved to make debugging easier.</text>
                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>Allow restores to be performed on a read-only repository by using <setting>--no-lock</setting> and <setting>--log-level-file=off</setting>.  The <setting>--no-lock</setting> option can only be used with restores.</text>

                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>The dev branch has been renamed to master and for the time being the master branch has renamed to release, though it will probably be removed at some point -- thus ends the gitflow experiment for <backrest/>.  It is recommended that any forks get re-forked and clones get re-cloned.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Symlinks are no longer created in backup directories in the repository.  These symlinks could point virtually anywhere and potentially be dangerous.  Symlinks are still recreated during a restore.</text>
                </release-feature>
                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added better messaging for backup expiration.  Full and differential backup expirations are logged on a single line along with a list of all dependent backups expired.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added a new user guide that covers <backrest/> basics and some advanced topics including PITR.  Much more to come, but it's a start.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Added new feature to allow all <backrest/> operations to be stopped or started using the <cmd>stop</cmd> and <cmd>start</cmd> commands.  This prevents any <backrest/> processes from running on a system where <postgres/> is shutdown or the system needs to be quiesced for some reason.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Fixed an issue where a resume would fail if temp files were left in the root backup directory when the backup failed.  This scenario was likely if the backup process got terminated during the copy phase.</text>

                <release-feature>
                    <text>Experimental support for <postgres/> 9.5 beta1.  This may break when the control version or WAL magic changes in future versions but will be updated in each <backrest/> release to keep pace.  All regression tests pass except for <setting>--target-resume</setting> tests (this functionality has changed in 9.5) and there is no testing yet for <file>.partial</file> WAL segments.</text>

                    <text><b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: This flag day release breaks compatibility with older versions of <backrest/>.  The manifest format, on-disk structure, and the binary names have all changed.  You must create a new repository to hold backups for this version of <backrest/> and keep your older repository for a time in case you need to do a restore.  The <file>pg_backrest.conf</file> file has not changed but you'll need to change any references to <file>pg_backrest.pl</file> in cron (or elsewhere) to <file>pg_backrest</file> (without the <file>.pl</file> extension).</text>

                    <text>More efficient file ordering for <cmd>backup</cmd>.  Files are copied in descending size order so a single thread does not end up copying a large file at the end.  This had already been implemented for <cmd>restore</cmd>.</text>

                    <text>Better resume support.  Resumed files are checked to be sure they have not been modified and the manifest is saved more often to preserve checksums as the backup progresses.  More unit tests to verify each resume case.</text>

                    <text>Fixed a buffering error that could occur on large, highly-compressible files when copying to an uncompressed remote destination.

                    <text>Added option <param>--no-start-stop</param> to allow backups when Postgres is shut down.  If <file>postmaster.pid</file> is present then <param>--force</param> is required to make the backup run (though if Postgres is running an inconsistent backup will likely be created).

                    <text>Working on improving error handling in the <code>File</code> object.

                    <text>Found and squashed a nasty bug where <code>file_copy()</code> was defaulted to ignore errors.  There was also an issue in <code>file_exists()</code> that was causing the test to fail when the file actually did exist.  Together they could have resulted in a corrupt backup with no errors, though it is very unlikely.</text>

                    <text>If an archive directory which should be empty could not be deleted backrest was throwing an error.  There's a good fix for that coming, but for the time being it has been changed to a warning so processing can continue.  This was impacting backups as sometimes the final archive file would not get pushed if the first archive file had been in a different directory (plus some bad luck).</text>

                    <text>No restore functionality, but the backup directories are consistent <postgres/> data directories.  You'll need to either uncompress the files or turn off compression in the backup.  Uncompressed backups on a ZFS (or similar) filesystem are a good option because backups can be restored locally via a snapshot to create logical backups or do spot data recovery.</text>
